            <h2>Welcome to Our Reading Group!</h2>
            <p>
                The Computational Cognitive Science Reading Group is a student-driven initiative to explore recent advancements in computational models of cognition.

                <h3>General Meeting Information</h3>
                <p class="indented-paragraph">
                    <strong>Meeting Time:</strong> Every other Tuesday, 6pm-8pm <br>
                    <strong>Meeting Location:</strong> room 358 in Building 420
                </p>
                <p class="indented-paragraph">
                    Sessions generally begin with dinner for 15-30 mins and then transition into 1.5 hrs for presentation/discussion.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Scope</h3>
                <p class="indented-paragraph">
                    Our main interests are in works that are motivated by modeling aspects of individual human cognition. We have additional
                    interest in works that make plausible contact with the human brain, which we inclusively define as any connectionist modeling and
                    anything that can be implemented with modern connectionist models. We prefer works that are more cognitively focused, but we are
                    also interested in works with more neural focus as long as they are cognitively related.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Audience and Format</h3>
                <p class="indented-paragraph">
                    We expect most interest to come from Cognitive Psychology, Computational Neuroscience, Computer Science, Linguistics, and
                    Philosophy graduate/research communities, but open to anyone who is interested.
                </p>
                <p class="indented-paragraph">
                    <strong>We expect attendees to have read the paper(s) before each meeting.</strong> It is okay for attendees to have a poor
                    understanding of the paper after their reading. We require, however, that attendees have at least made a faithful effort to read the
                    paper(s).
                </p>
                <p class="indented-paragraph">
                    Each session will have one or two discussion leaders who have read and understood the paper deeply. The sessions will begin with
                    a presentation from the discussion leader(s) to provide interactive context of the papers (30 min or less). They will then lead a
                    discussion which can take the form of posing questions to the group or soliciting thoughts to the effect of deepening the group’s
                    understanding of ideas surrounding the paper.
                </p>
